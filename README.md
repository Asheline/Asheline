# Hi! Welcome to my GitHub-profile! 
My name is **Sofie**, also known as **Asheline** or **Demiample**.
I'm an **Artist**, **Web Designer** and a **Developer**.
-   ðŸ‘€  Iâ€™m interested in coding, designing, and learning new coding languages.
-   ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently working as an annotator.


# My Experience

I began learning how to code back in 2020 when I started studying to become a developer. Since then, I've gained experience in **C**, **C#**, **C++**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **Kotlin**. I have also learned how to use the **Vue** framework and worked as an annotator on the [Roadview project](https://roadview-project.eu/).

I am particularly interested in web programming, focusing mainly on the Front End side.

I'm always looking for more ways to improve myself on my developing journey.

## Interests

As a child, I have always made art to brighten people's days. These days I use my **graphic design skills** to design logos, websites and models. Demonstrations of my artwork can be found on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/demiample).

I'm also interested in streaming video games, so if you want to meet me there go check my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/asheline_) channel.
