# Hi! Welcome to my GitHub-profile! 
My name is **Sofie VÃ¤isÃ¤nen**, also known as **Asheline** or **Demiample**.
I'm an **Artist**, **Web Designer** and a **Developer**.
-   ðŸ‘€  Iâ€™m interested in coding, designing, and learning new coding languages.
-   ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning threejs, JavaScript. A 3D-Map project is what I'm currently working on.


# My Experience

As a relatively new  developer, I began learning how to code back in 2020. Since then, I've gained experience in **C**, **C#**, **C++**, **JavaScript** and **ThreeJs**. 

I'm always looking for more ways to improve myself on my developing journey.

## Interests

As a child, I have always made art to brighten people's days. These days I use my **graphic design skills** to design logos, websites and models. Demonstrations of my artwork can be found on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/demiample).
